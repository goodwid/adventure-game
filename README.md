## Johnny & David's text adventure game

#### [Live website](http://goodwid.github.io/adventure-game/server/public/)

You wake up somewhat disoriented in a comfy bed in a strange house.  You look around but can't get your bearings.  All you know for sure is that you need to get out of the house, and the only way out is through the front door.

So begins our classic adventure game.  There are items to find, clues to discover, and a monster to fight, in order to get to the front door and freedom.

To install, clone this repo, then:

    cd app  
    npm install  
    npm run build  
    cd ../server
    npm install  
    npm start

Connect a browser to localhost:9000 and enjoy the game!
